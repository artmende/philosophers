each philo is a thread.

they all wait at first that all of them are created.

then one of them will store the starting time and they will all start the simulation

first the philo try to eat. when its time for them to eat they actually dont do anything else than trying

they have their own fork and can access the fork if their neighbor

if their own fork is free and one of the neighbor fork is free too, philo lock both fork and eat


malloced stuff : 

threads
forks
last eat array
philo struct
need to destroy mutex first%
